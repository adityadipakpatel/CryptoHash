## Introduction
This project is a deep dive into the SHA256 algorithm. It was initiated with the aim of understanding the intricacies of the SHA256 algorithm and implementing it in Python. The Python implementation is designed to mimic the functionality of the SHA256 algorithm that can be executed from the command line.

## SHA256 Algorithm
The SHA256 algorithm is a cryptographic hash function that produces a 256-bit (32-byte) hash value. It's commonly used in various security applications and protocols, including TLS and SSL, PGP, SSH, IPsec, and more. It's also accessible via the command line in many systems.

## Implementation in Python
The SHA256 algorithm was implemented in Python as part of this project. The implementation involved creating a function that takes an input (or 'message'), and returns a hash of this message, which is a fixed-size string of bytes. This Python implementation provides the same functionality as the SHA256 command-line operation.

## Conclusion
Through this project, a comprehensive understanding of the SHA256 algorithm was achieved. The implementation of the algorithm in Python further solidified this understanding and provided practical experience in applying cryptographic hash functions. The Python implementation is equivalent to the SHA256 algorithm that can be run using the command line.
